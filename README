dzwm - dz window manager
============================
dzwm is a fork of dwm version 6.5.
dzwm is heavily modified from original dwm to suit my needs and preferences
so that dwm patches can no longer be applied without some change,
which is why I forked it.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dzwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dzwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dzwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dzwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dzwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dzwm

(This will start dzwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dzwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code the same way as in dwm.
